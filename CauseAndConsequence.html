	<h2>Underlying-Causes</h2>
	<h2>Britains and Frances Long Term Historic Rivalry</h2>
	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Philip_James_de_Loutherbourg_-_The_Battle_of_Alexandria%2C_21_March_1801_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">
	<p><strong>Throughout this time, enlightenment and democratic ideas and concepts spread through Europe, and later the colonies. These ideas are what made the colonists have resentment for their lack of representation and say in the government, and to even consider the radical idea of a monarch-less republic; unheard of at the time.</strong></p>
	<p>The Seven Years war occurs across many continents, most importantly in North America (for us). This war drains the British governments funds leading them to levy taxes on the colonies. This request was much different from other tax-calls because of the  enlightenment ideas coursing through European intellectuals that spread to the new world.</p>
	<p>With these enlightenment ideas, a good chunk of colonists found being taxed and controlled by monarchs who have not their interests in mind with little to no representation unacceptable and unfair. Even though the the Americans placed great importance on commerce and very often got around paying these taxes (Through smuggling, boycotting, etc), it was often the part of having no representation that brought out the revolutionary fervour. To them, it was simply unfair. Many have said that representation and being “bullied” was a more important and driving force then simply paying taxes.</p>

	<h2>Direct Causes</h2>
	<h2>Immediate actions at self-governance.</h2>
	<img src="	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/General_George_Washington_Resigning_his_Commission.jpg
">
	<p>With all of these apparent injustices, the first Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia to further the rights of the colonists and an attempt to separate their decisions from the crown. This was incredibly important in this war becoming a cohesive and organized attack on British sovereignty across all colonies. This was a concrete and actionable step towards self-governing.</p>	

	<h2>Early Military Actions on Both Sides of the Conflict</h2>
	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/The_Battle_of_Lexington.jpg">
	<p>Increased presence and action of the British Army in the colonies in light of the colonies having greater independence or sovereignty. The battles at both Lexington and Concord where directly caused by the British wishing to seize the colonials' weapons to stymie any attempts at further independence. The widespread confiscation of weapons and gunpowder by force of violence –an action  believed as an attempt to disarm the populace and force them to accept British dominance – turned the rising tensions into a shooting-war. It was a direct attack on their rights, and ability to self-govern. This point, of the confiscation of weapons, could arguably be said to be the most important factor to the outbreak of the initial battles.</p>
	<p>The tipping point of the tensions came on the first battles of the Revolutionary war at Lexington and Concord. These battles were greatly important for both being the first battles, and also proving to the American peoples that a militia of common non-soldiers could inflict heavy casualties, and win, against the professional British army. The British defeat and the ferocity of the fighting that the Americans displayed forced the British to view the militia as not just a motley band of unorganized rebels, hardly a major threat, but instead a force that deserved respect and to be viewed as an army on peer with the British, or even superior.</p>

	<h2>Short-Term Consequences</h2>
	<h2>The Small Skirmishes Spilling Over Into A Full Sized War</h2>
	<img src="https://mtv-main-assets.mountvernon.org/files/callout/text-image-block-full/image/washington-at-monmouth-web.jpg">
	<p>The initial small-scale skirmishes brought the conflict into a full war for independence, with the war becoming much larger very quickly. Within a few months of this initial breakout, battles with tens of thousands of participants would happen.</p>

	<h2>Goal Of The Revolutionary War Becoming Independence</h2>
	<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Declaration_of_Independence_%281819%29%2C_by_John_Trumbull.jpg/1200px-Declaration_of_Independence_%281819%29%2C_by_John_Trumbull.jpg">
	<p>The original intention of the revolution was not nearly as radical as what it soon became. The cause was not originally to go directly to full-scale war and revolt, but to ease things out through legislation and agreement. It was to be a war fought with the quill, and not so much the gun.</p>

	<h2>Long-Term Consequences</h2>
	<h2>The Introduction of a Republican System</h2>
	<img src="https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/art/a_three_sections_with_teasers/graphics/CROPPEDIdeaoftheSenate.jpg">
	<p>The introduction of a republican system to the world that greatly shaped the course of history all across the world. The first large-scale example of a country overthrowing its monarch and establishing a successful republic that does not fall into despotism.</p>

	<h2>Influencing, and Causing, The French Revolution</h2>
	<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/da/c7/40dac77f623916cea8cbda79d36e7d9d.png">
	<p>The American revolution heavily influenced the French revolution, and was a base of sorts for their proposed system. For example, the French National Assembly modelled their deceleration of rights off of the American Deceleration of Independence.</p>
	<p>Also, the direct involvement of the French in both the Sevens Years War and the Revolutionary War caused immense financial strain onto France, which caused their revolution and, arguably more importantly, the conditions for a dictator, Napoleon, to rise. Napoleons conquests through Europe could be said to be one of the driving factors towards German and Italian nationalism and unification, which in turn spread a fervour of nationalism and liberalism through Europe, and consequently the world.</p><p> The world we know today, one of solely nation-states, can be traced back directly to these events; our world would be unrecognizable without a globe of nation-states.</p>

	<h2>The Expansion of America Past the Appalachians</h2>
	<img src="https://www.artranked.com/images/9a/9a52da1df76fbe7eaf2468b422b71079.jpeg">
	<p>By overthrowing British rule, the new American republic was no longer bound by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, and could expand past the Appalachians and as expand towards the west. The purchase of Louisiana and the concept of Manifest Destiny directly led to the United States becoming the most powerful force in North America, with a country spanning from sea to “shining” sea.</p>
	<p>By vast amounts of land being available for Americans to cultivate, the democratic, and Jeffersonian idea of a limited and local government to suit small scale subsistence farming and an agrarian democracy was possible. These ideas reinforced the belief that in order to be truly free, one needs to be self-sufficient and not reliant on foreign imports, or wages for workers. This culminated in the embargo act, and the establishment of US isolationism; the end of Mercantilism in America.</p>
