	<h1>Continuities</h1>
	<br>
		<h2>General Mistreatment of "Colored" Peoples</h2>

	<p>The revolution and change in representation did not affect the treatment of the lower ranks of society.</p>

	<p>It has arguably been said that the revolution, and subsequent change in rule, negatively effected the enslaved by postponing the abolition of slavery decades later, and much less bloody, than what it would have likely been under British rule.</p>

	<p>Another mistreated group, the American Indians, would still be treated very poorly after the revolution, and arguably worse. The British did put firm limits onto the the colonies and to make sure that land would not be expanded into Indian territories. In that sense, the British were softer on the Indians than the Americans.</p>
	<br/>
	<h2>The Country's Economic and Social divide</h2>

	<p>The northern portion of the country stayed a manufacturing hub and free while the southern portion of the country remained agrarian, and mostly plantation-based with slaves. This continuity would only strengthen when the industrial revolution went into full swing, and the country opened up more to foreign export and large industry.</p>
	
	<h1>Changes</h1>
	<br/>
	<h2>Colonial Mercantilism Ceased to Be</h2>
	<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c4/c9/f5/c4c9f57ee2598d6540e8cebe9c7106db.jpg">
	<p>The concept of Colonial mercantilism in the Colonies ceased to be a driving economic principle after the democratic party held office uncontested after the 2nd presidency. </p>

	<h2>Political Participation in the Colonies</h2>
	<img src="https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/Fall-2016-Wasley-Voting-Bingham.jpg">
	<p>With the original requirements to vote, land-owning (Emphasis on land-owning) protestant men above 21, only 10-20% of peoples (Including the sizable slave population) could vote, and always the upper ranks of society.</p>
	<p>This was more representation than before, but it's best not to think the original system was some totally representative and flawless system; political corruption and fraud was commonplace, like in one case when landowners would grant temporary land to men to vote, then reclaim it back.</p>

	<h2>The Concept of Social-Mobility</h2>
	<img src="https://en.bcdn.biz/Images/2015/8/18/1183e683-4064-4bf5-aaa9-6173cde2f59e.jpg">
	<p>The president of the United States, Jackson, was born into poverty to foreigner parents (But it must be noted he was incredibly wealthy by his inauguration) and he held the same office as Jefferson and Washington, two incredibly wealthy officeholders. The polarity found in the government was something unheard of in England or previous forms of government.</p>
