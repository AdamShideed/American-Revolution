	<h2>Loyalists Living in New England</h2>

	<p style="margin-top: 10px"><strong>Event: Treaty of Paris.</strong></p>
	<p>The treaty of Paris  in 1783 had brought an end to the war, and an end to the lives of many loyalists living in the former colonies; both physically and metaphorically. There was now official recognition of the United States; the war had been lost.</p>
	<p>The loyalists, as being on the losing side, would feel defeated and againsts the treaty, but there was nothing they could do. Their lives were over, and they were helpless. The loyalist living in New England is a proper distinction because a Loyalist living in, for example, South Carolina, would have a much more treacherous and hopeless situation compared to a New Englander because of the proximity of English Canada.</p>
	
	<h2>A French Quebecer </h2>

	<p style="margin-top: 10px"><strong>Event: Expulsion of English Loyalists into Ethnically French Areas.</strong></p>
	<p>The expulsion of Loyalists from the colonies during and after the Revolutionary War would be much against the locals. The french, even though they were under British Occupation and for the Revolutionary war, would hate the stream of patriotic Protestant British settlers changing the then homogenous cultural landscape.</p>
	<p>This point will be very significant in the establishment of our Modern Canada.</p>
